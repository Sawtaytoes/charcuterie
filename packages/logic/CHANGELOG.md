# @charcuterie/logic

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5a4433d: Share the slot/clone `ref` + `on*` merge primitives. `mergeRefs`, `chainHandlers`,
  `isMergeableRef`, `isEventHandlerName` and the `MergeableRef` type move into
  `@charcuterie/logic/react` (`mergeRefsAndHandlers.ts`) and become public exports of
  `@charcuterie/logic`; `@charcuterie/ui`'s `slotWiring.ts` imports them instead of
  carrying a byte-identical copy, keeping only its own `mergeSlotWiring`. No behaviour
  change — the React implementation (with its React 19 callback-ref cleanup) is the one
  kept. The Preact mirror is intentionally _not_ shared: its `mergeRefs` is genuinely
  different (Preact has no ref-cleanup return), so this is a react↔ui dedup only.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cab09e5: Add the three-mode (light / dark / system) colour-scheme switcher.

  - `@charcuterie/logic`: `createColorScheme` core + `useColorScheme` hook with an
    injectable resolver (`{ get, subscribe }`) and injectable persistence; a new
    `@charcuterie/logic/browser` subpath ships the `matchMedia` / `localStorage` /
    `data-scheme` defaults so non-browser consumers (Electron `nativeTheme`,
    React-Native `Appearance`) never import the DOM.
  - `@charcuterie/ui`: `ColorSchemeToggle` (Layer 2, presentational, controlled) and
    `ColorSchemeSwitcher` (Layer 3, connected — the only layer that touches the browser).
  - `@charcuterie/tokens`: `buildFirstPaintScript(variant, { storageKey })` — the inline
    `<head>` script that sets `data-scheme` before first paint from the persisted/OS choice
    and branches the fallback hex on the resolved scheme, sharing a storage key
    (`DEFAULT_COLOR_SCHEME_STORAGE_KEY`) with the runtime hook.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f78d5b: A slot's `ref` composes with the one already there, instead of replacing it.

  `Menu` and `Tooltip` could not share a trigger. Both clone onto it and both hand it a
  floating-ui `refs.setReference` — an anchor, not an attribute — and every merge in the
  library was last-write-wins, so the inner clone's ref replaced the outer one's. The menu was
  left with no reference element and floating-ui parked its panel at `left: 0; top: 0`, in the
  corner of the viewport. Nothing threw, the ARIA was intact and axe was clean; it read as a
  CSS bug.

  A `ref` is a subscription and an `on*` is a listener, and neither survives being replaced. So
  both are merged now, at both levels where a slot writes them:

  - **`useClonedChild`** merges with the element **you** wrote, so
    `<Menu trigger={<Button ref={buttonRef} onClick={toggle} />} />` keeps your ref _and_ your
    handler — previously it silently discarded both. React and Preact bindings alike.
  - **`mergeSlotProps`** merges the `ref` and chains the handlers between two nested slots,
    alongside the five attributes it already settled.

  Values are unaffected: a slot is still the later writer and still wins, which is what makes
  `Field`'s `id` work.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- a01d7a6: 1.0.0 — the API has survived contact with the fleet

  All five packages go to `1.0.0` together, as their own changeset rather than folded into a
  consumer's, so the release that stabilises the API is legible on its own in the changelog.
  [Decision](../docs/decisions/2026-07-31-one-point-oh-cuts-at-the-end-of-m6.md).

  **Nothing in this bump changes an API.** It is a promise about the ones already here: from
  now on `^1.0.0` takes every minor, and a breaking change goes to `2.0.0`, where an install
  stops and someone reads this file.

  That is not ceremony. Pre-1.0, **the minor is the breaking channel** — `^0.1.0` means
  `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0` — and it had already bitten on this very library. `tokens@0.2.0` replaced
  five of the six ePaper Spectra 6 values and its own changeset said _"breaking for anyone
  reading these literals"_, yet every consumer pinned `^0.1.0`. So the corrected palette, the
  entire point of M5b's finding, reached **none** of them, and did so **silently**: the range
  resolves happily to the old version instead of failing.

  The cut waited for the consumers rather than for a date. `@charcuterie/ui` reached exactly
  one app when M6 opened; it is now imported by **five** — mux-magic (28 files), rip-deck
  (11), gallery-downloader (19), image-viewer (14) and plex-channels (10) — and the three
  modernizations M6 had to do before any of that could happen (image-viewer off `.jsx` +
  Emotion; plex-channels and gallery-downloader onto React + Tailwind from no build system at
  all) are what it cost. castkit consumes `tokens` and `logic` only, which is M5b's finding
  standing rather than a gap: the component layer does not reach a Preact consumer. `xander`
  is deliberately not among them either — Kevin's call was to leave it alone
  (_"he's doing his own thing. I can have him use Charcuterie once we get this settled"_),
  which is why the last-consumer condition resolves here rather than at a fourth migration.

  Waiting was the point, and M6 kept proving it. M5b's _"the component layer does not reach a
  Preact consumer"_ is exactly the kind of finding that must not arrive **after** a stability
  promise — and M6f found two more of them, in `Field`/`Tooltip` nesting and in `LogViewer`
  inside a collapsed `Accordion`, both invisible to this repo's own suite and both surfaced by
  an app actually using the thing. Those are fixed in this release. A 1.0.0 cut a milestone
  earlier would have shipped both.

  Also folded in, rather than shipped as an intermediate `tokens@0.3.0` no consumer could
  have installed: the first-paint (`var()` fallback) snippet and the widened 19-colour ePaper
  flat-fill palette. Both are `minor` on a `0.x` line, which is to say both were unreachable
  behind every consumer's caret — publishing them as `0.3.0` on the way past would have been
  a release with no possible audience.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial public release of the Charcuterie fleet library: the design tokens, the five state kinds (Visibility, VisibilityGroup, SinglePicker, MultiplePicker, RovingFocus, Status), the component set, and the shared ESLint + Biome configs.
